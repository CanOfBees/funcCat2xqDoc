# funcCat2xqDoc #
## w3.org Function Catalogs To xqDoc ##

## What & Why ##
**What:** A attempt (for fun!) at writing some XQuery to parse W3 Function Catalog files and output xqDoc blocks.

**Why:** Fun! Learnin'! The quite-probably-mistaken belief that I'd be able to save a bit of time on a support project by applying a bit of automation!

## How ##
I've been using [BaseX](https://basex.org) to run this like so:

```shell
$ basex src/funcCat2xqDoc.xq > some-file.txt
```

Please note that this is a largely half-baked thing: while the formatting isn't completely broken, it's still so far from finished that it may as well be unusable.
